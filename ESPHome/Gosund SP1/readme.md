This esphome config works with Gosund SP1 power plugs [Amazon.ES](https://www.amazon.es/-/pt/gp/product/B098382DKQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Please, make sure you don't connect the power plugs to tuya app, because if the firmware is updated to the latest version, tuya-convert may not work.
